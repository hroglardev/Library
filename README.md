# Library

A project to display information of books in card form.

# What the project is about

This project's purpose is to retrieve information from a mock database (represented in an array in this case) and display it on the browser in real time. The app allows users to remove movies from the list, toggle information to see if a book has been read or not and add books to the list.

# What have I learned so far?

This library project introduced me to the basics of object oriented programming and allowed to see first hand the benefits of splitting code for better readability. Read below what I implemented and learned.

<ul>
  <li>Implementation of CSS variables to handle dark-mode.</li>
  <li>Constructor functions to create book objects.</li>
  <li>Dynamic DOM manipulation.</li>
  <li>Real time form validation, including submission prevention.</li>
  <li>Code modularity and split responsibility in functions.</li>
</ul>

# Explanation of the code

The code is split into separate files to separate concerns.
